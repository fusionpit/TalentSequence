# Talent Sequence
Talent Sequence is an addon for World of Warcraft Classic that adds the ability to import talents by level from [Wowhead's Classic Talent Calculator](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc). It also includes accommodations for the Talented addon.

## Preparation
To use the Talent Sequence addon, you must have a URL from [Wowhead's Classic Talent Calculator](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc) and have the Talent Order section expanded(see below).

Successfully importing a sequence for a class that is not the current character's class will be met with a success message.
